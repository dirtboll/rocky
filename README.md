# Rocky - Simple 3D collision library for Nim.

Inspired by [treeform/bumpy](https://github.com/treeform/bumpy)

## About

This library is an implementation of [MDN's 3D Collision Detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection). It uses [treeform/vmath](https://github.com/treeform/vmath) for math operations. Currently only implements bounding box and sphere.
